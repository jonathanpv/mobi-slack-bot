<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

During a session of [social coding](https://utamobi.com/pages/SocialCoding.html) Zach started setting up a slack bot on Glitch so we could all
code a few fun messages and get an introduction to Javascript, after a few days I found myself being the most active on the fun project and decided
to expand and deliver a few features.

### On the Front-End
- we don't have one but if you want to make one just create the files `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html` and hack away!
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

### On the Back-End
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json` these packages are usually found in npm
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite) plz no dox
- we use axios for get requests
- mongodb is used for a database why? because mongo sounds like mango
- we tried keeping things neat by keeping things seperated which is why there's `src/channel-id.js` and more
- look at some of the examples on `src/server.js` if you need help ping us on slack! hope you have fun and learn! :)

### Feature Overview
* Members can easily access Mobi's frequently asked questions through a command
* Browse the top posts of Reddit's r/programmerhumor within Slack 
* When members join, Mobi bot greets them with a random message from a list of templates in welcome-messages.js
* Channel moderators can test what a new user onboarding is with /newusertest
* Fun commands to keep members engaged and eager to program their own commands! 
    * such as ``translateto dothraki`` to translate your message to dothraki 
    * ``$STOCK_TICKER_SYMBOL`` to retrieve a current price and volume information of a specified stock 
    * ``show me a cat fact`` to display a random cat fact 
    * ``And many more to come!`` 

### Project Goal
The aim of this project was to create something useful for new members and be able to onboard them to Mobi and help them learn some Javascript along
the way, and hopefully getting them excited about hacking their own features!

For more information on how to add your own feature keep reading!

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
* [Slack Bolt Javascript](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/concepts)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Fun APIs we found from Google, here's a neat article of some](https://dev.to/biplov/15-fun-apis-for-your-next-project-5053)

### Glitch
Glitch is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.

## Demo
Below is a gif deomnstrating the commands and the responses mobi bot has for them, although it shows the channel being in a dm with the bot these messages also work in public and private channels since the bot can listen to events server-wide
