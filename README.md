The Mobi Bot Project
------------

On the front-end,
- we don't have one but if you want to make one just create the files `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html` and hack away!
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json` these packages are usually found in npm
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite) plz no dox
- we use axios for get requests
- mongodb is used for a database why? because mongo sounds like mango
- we tried keeping things neat by keeping things seperated which is why there's `src/channel-id.js` and more
- look at some of the examples on `src/server.js` if you need help ping us on slack! hope you have fun and learn! :)
