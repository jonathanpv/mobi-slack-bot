// file where all the message templates are found they are used for many different chat commands

// for example cat_fact is the chat template that can be processed in the server.js file
// we can add some obvious place holder values such as "{{FactAPI}}" and when we processes it
// in server.js we can use the replace function to replace "{{FactAPI}}" with the actual
// data we want

// messages are called "blocks", which you can learn more about
// here: api.slack.com/block-kit

// you can build and experiment live with blocks
